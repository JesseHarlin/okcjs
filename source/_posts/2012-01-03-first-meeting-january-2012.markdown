The inagural OKC.js meeting will be in January, and the exact time and details are yet to be determined. All we know for sure right now is that it will be hosted at the [okcCoCo](http://okccoco.com) in Midtown OKC.

If you would like to propose a talk for the meeting or volunteer to speak, please email [vance@brightb.it](mailto:vance@brightb.it) with your ideas.
