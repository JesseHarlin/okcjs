The OKC.js user group is dedicated to providing the Oklahoma City, OK developer community with training and learning resources to gain a better understanding and knowledge of JavaScript in a variety of different environments. Most of the time this comes in the form of monthly meetings with presentations, but could also include community events, blog posts, links, videos, and other resources.


Newsletter & Mailing List
-------------------------

The OKC.js newsletter is sent once per month and contains the meeting announcement for the current month. It also contains any other relevant information like upcoming community events and sponsorship information (like if lunch is provided).

[Subscribe to the OKC.js newsletter & mailing list](http://eepurl.com/iQakz)

We may also use the mailing list to make special announcements like upcoming web or JavaScript events in the area, but it will NEVER be used for spam or commercial purposes.
